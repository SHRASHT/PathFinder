# üîß INNGEST NOT SYNCING - DIAGNOSIS

## Current Status:

‚úÖ Inngest Dev Server is running on port 8288  
‚ùå Inngest can't find your Next.js app  
‚ùì Next.js might be on a different port than 3000

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Find Next.js Port

Run in a NEW terminal:

```cmd
.\find-nextjs-port.bat
```

### 2. If Next.js is on Different Port

Example: If Next.js is on port 3001 instead of 3000:

1. **Stop Inngest** (Ctrl+C in Inngest terminal)
2. **Restart with correct URL:**
   ```cmd
   npx inngest-cli@latest dev --url=http://localhost:3001/api/inngest
   ```

### 3. Alternative: Force Next.js to Port 3000

1. **Stop Next.js** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Start with specific port:**
   ```cmd
   npm run dev -- --port 3000
   ```
3. **Then restart Inngest:**
   ```cmd
   npx inngest-cli@latest dev
   ```

## What to Look For:

- ‚úÖ "Found Next.js on port XXXX"
- ‚úÖ "Test Inngest endpoint: http://localhost:XXXX/api/inngest"
- ‚úÖ Inngest shows "Synced" status after restart

## Expected Result:

Inngest Dashboard shows your functions and "Connected" status.

**Try: `.\find-nextjs-port.bat` first to locate Next.js!**
