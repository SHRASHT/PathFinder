# 🔧 INNGEST DEBUG - STEP BY STEP

## Current Status: DEBUGGING INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

### What I've Done:

1. ✅ Simplified the Inngest route to minimal test function
2. ✅ Enhanced error logging in client and route
3. ✅ Removed all complex dependencies (AI, agent-kit)
4. ✅ Fixed syntax errors

### 📋 Next Steps to Test:

1. **Test the endpoint directly:**

   ```cmd
   .\test-endpoint.bat
   ```

2. **Check Next.js console logs:**

   - Look at the terminal running `npm run dev`
   - Should see debug messages about Inngest setup

3. **If endpoint works, try Inngest Dev Server:**
   ```cmd
   npx inngest-cli@latest dev
   ```

### 🔍 What to Look For:

**In Next.js terminal:**

- ✅ "Starting Inngest route setup..."
- ✅ "Test function created successfully"
- ✅ "Inngest serve() completed successfully"
- ❌ Any error messages

**Expected endpoint response:**

```json
{
  "message": "success",
  "functions": [
    {
      "id": "simple-test",
      "name": "simple-test"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🚨 If Still Failing:

- Check environment variables in `.env.local`
- Verify Inngest package version
- Check for port conflicts
- Look for firewall issues

**Next**: Run `.\test-endpoint.bat` to test the minimal setup!
